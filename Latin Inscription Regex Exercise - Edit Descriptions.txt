The first thing that I did was identify all of the reference numbers by using (EDR\d+). I then put in 2 line breaks after the end of each inscription and before each refernce number, and 1 between the reference and actual inscription. 
I then went about deleting the line numbers, as I did not know how to move them to the end of the line other than to write them in, as these numbers make the document look more messy. I did this by putting (^\d) in the search bar to look for any single numbers on their own, as the only ones of these that would appear would be the line number 5, as the only other numbers are either the line number 10 (made up of 2 numbers), or the reference numbers, made up of a longer string of numbers. The line number ‘10’ was deleted through similar methods to the line number '5' by searching for (^\d\d) and deleting the results. 
The final thing I did was to add a full stop at the end of each inscription, I did this by searching for the end of the string and the start of a non-word boundary by using the Regex (\Z)(\B), and then adding a full stop where this found the edge of an inscription. There were a number of times where a string ended in a bracket or an equals sign which were also highlighted, but these were then skipped and only the ends of each inscription edited.
